"A "sismos" (Earthquakes) table contains a created, lat, long, depth, richter, location country. This is the table:

CREATE TABLE sismos (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL, 
	created DATETIME, 
	lat FLOAT, 
	long FLOAT, 
	depth FLOAT, 
	richter FLOAT, 
	description VARCHAR, 
	location VARCHAR, 
	country VARCHAR, 
	content_hash VARCHAR, 
	PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

* country ("sismos"."country") names such as Panama and Panama with a tilde should work as well, so for it should add an extra condition, for Panam√° OR Panama.
* location field's ("sismos"."location") queries of the sismos table should be a "like query" and should not match any "country" query.
* user prompt can be in any human language you understand but likely it would be Spanish.
* if limit not found limit the query to 5 results, always order by created desc
* only generate SQL SELECT statements do not generate any comment or any other text

Create a SQL query using Sqlite3 syntax using my table for user prompt:
